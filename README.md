# c-web-server
This is just a simple web server with 2 routes, and garbage code.

## FEATURES
- Very garbage code
- Not scalable

__Routes__:
- `/`
- `/about`
- and a `404 not found` page when the route doesnt exist.

## __MUST HAVE__
Linux/macOS: 
- *make*
- *GCC*

Windows (never tested on windows):
- *some sort of **make** port for windows*
- *a C compiler*


## Running the server 

```
git clone <insert-link-of-repo>
cd ./c-web-server
make build
./main
```
Then open your browser and type in the link `localhost:42069`,
or whatever port you set it to.

## TODO
- [ ] *Update the data structures, make a dictionary or something.
- [ ] Maybe use a binary search tree for the routes (?)

```
